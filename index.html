    <h1>The Old Man And the Sea</h1>
    <h2>By Ernest Hemingway</h2>
    <h3>1952</h3>
    <h2>Part 4</h2>
    <p>The elderly fisherman Santiago has not caught a fish in eighty-four days and is considered salao (very unlucky). The parents of the boy Manolin, whom Santiago had trained, have forced their son to work on a different, luckier boat; Manolin still helps Santiago prepare his gear every morning and evening and brings him food. They talk about baseball and Joe DiMaggio, before the boy leaves and Santiago sleeps. He dreams of the sights and experiences of his youth.</p>
